CHIRP worked with national partners to successfully pass a bill through Congress, the Local Community Radio Act, that has allowed more than 1,000 new stations across the country to go on the air.\n\nCHIRP launched its station online at chirpradio.org in 2010, and hit the terrestrial airwaves at 107.1FM in late 2017. During that time, CHIRP has grown from a small organization into a well-loved, community-focused radio station with one staff member and more than 250 volunteers.',

During that time, she and then-Vice President Jennifer Lizak led a White House meeting on the low-power FM broadcast issue with President Obama\'s technology team.

The volunteers and staff at CHIRP are true believers in radio that is diverse, exciting, live, and locally-based. Community radio is non-commercial, and is created by regular people from all walks of life, not just broadcast professionals. It is committed to playing music the big stations won\'t touch, and to focusing on the vibrant culture of a community that often flies under the radar.\n\nCHIRP launched its station online at CHIRPradio.org in January of 2010. From the time the organization was founded, its members also worked to convince Congress and the Federal Communications Commission to allow new LPFM stations in big cities. CHIRP volunteers and supporters called their legislators and filed public comments with the FCC. In 2010, the bill CHIRP had worked to support, the Local Community Radio Act, was signed into law by President Obama and handed to the Federal Communications Commission to implement.\n\nIn October 2013, the FCC opened its first low-power FM application window in thirteen years, and for the first time made room for urban applicants. CHIRP submitted its broadcast license application in November 2013, and almost exactly one year later, was awarded a broadcast license for 107.1FM.\n\nCHIRP launched its terrestrial broadcast on October 21, 2017 at 107.1FM on the north side of Chicago. Meanwhile, thanks to the bill we helped pass, 700 other new community stations are on the air across the country.',
